#### Speed up page loading times and decrease traffic by only loading images as they enter the viewport.
The Image component improves page speed significantly by following these methods:




### Usage
Use a Grid class to a block element to give it a max-width and wrap the main content of your website.
The element will be centered and have padding on the sides, that adapts automatically for large screens.

### Size modifiers
Add one of the following props to the container to apply a different max-width.

```jsx
<React.Fragment>
    <Image src="https://getuikit.com/docs/images/light.jpg" alt="Image" />
</React.Fragment>
```
