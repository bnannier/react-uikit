### Usage
Use a Sample class to a block element to give it a max-width and wrap the main content of your website.
The element will be centered and have padding on the sides, that adapts automatically for large screens.

### Size modifiers
Add one of the following classes to the container to apply a different max-width.

```jsx
<React.Fragment>
    <Sample>Default</Sample>
    <Sample xsmall>Extra Small</Sample>
    <Sample small>Small</Sample>
    <Sample large>Large</Sample>
    <Sample expand>Expand</Sample>
</React.Fragment>
```
